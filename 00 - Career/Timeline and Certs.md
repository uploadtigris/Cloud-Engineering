## Key Principle
=======

**After Security+ (now):**

- Continue help desk while studying RHCSA
- Build homelab projects showcasing Linux + automation skills
- Start networking and tailoring resume for DevOps roles

**After RHCSA (~9-10 months total):**

- Target roles: _Junior Linux Administrator, Systems Administrator, Junior DevOps Engineer, Cloud Support Engineer_
- **Primary focus: Get out of help desk into any technical infrastructure role**
- Start applying aggressively - this is your exit point

**After AWS SA (~12-13 months total):**

- Target roles: _Junior DevOps Engineer, Junior Cloud Engineer, Infrastructure Engineer, AWS Support Engineer_
- **This is your power combo: Linux + Cloud + Security baseline**
- Best chance at landing DevOps roles

### Phase 2: Build DevOps Experience (Years 1-3)

**Junior DevOps/Infrastructure Role (1-2 years):**

### Phase 4: Senior/Specialized Roles (Years 3-5+)

**Target paths:**

- **Site Reliability Engineer** (strong Linux + cloud + automation + monitoring)
- **Platform Engineer** (Kubernetes, IaC, developer tooling)
- **Senior DevOps Engineer** (architecture, mentoring, complex systems)
- **Cloud Architect** (AWS expertise + multi-cloud strategy)
## Action Items

- [ ] Pass Security+ in 2 weeks
- [ ] Start RHCSA study immediately (dedicate 10-15 hrs/week)
- [ ] Build homelab projects in parallel:
    - [ ] Linux server hardening and automation scripts
    - [ ] Basic AWS infrastructure with Terraform
    - [ ] Simple CI/CD pipeline (Jenkins/GitHub Actions)
- [ ] **Exit help desk after RHCSA (don't wait for AWS SA)**
- [ ] Complete AWS SA within first 6 months of new role
- [ ] GitHub portfolio showcasing all projects
## Key Principles

- **Exit help desk after RHCSA - don't wait for all certs**
- **Projects > Certs when job hunting - show you can do the work**
- **Sec+ satisfies security baseline for most roles (bonus differentiator)**
- **Get real DevOps experience ASAP, continue learning on the job**
