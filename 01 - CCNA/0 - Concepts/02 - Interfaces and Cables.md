Network Protocols
- RJ-45 (Registered Jack 45)

Bits and Bytes
- Bit is 0 or 1
- 8 bits = 1 Bytes
- **speed is measured in BITS per second**

UTP --> Unshielded Twisted Pair
- Unshielded --> vulnerable to interference

Routers and the PCs work the same! ( "Straight-through cable")

**Cannot send data from router to router or switch to switch **

To transmit and receive data between switches or routers you will need a **crossover cable**

**modern solution --> Auto MDI-X:** 
- understands which devices are plugged in and switching the functions of the pins on the device side. This way, we dont need to worry about crossover or straight-through cabling.
