- notice the 98% of the CPU
- worm --> usually is seen as high network activity. Replicates itself over a network
- cryptomalware --> this is likely the answer ; eats up a lot of CPU and GPU resources
- Remote Access Trojan (RAT) --> usually positioned as a backdoor. Best if it stays stealthy.
- adware --> scamware would be more subtle
- Spyware --> would be more stealthy
