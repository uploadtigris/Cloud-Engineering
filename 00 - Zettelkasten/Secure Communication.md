SD-WAN
- a modern approach that uses software to intelligently manage and optimize a company's network connections, abstracting away the underlying physical hardware to provide centralized control, cost savings, and improved performance for connecting distributed locations and cloud applications.

Secure Access Service Edge (SASE)
- ==a cloud-native framework that combines SD-WAN with security services like ZTNA, CASB, FWaaS, and SWG to secure distributed users and devices==. It enhances security by enforcing consistent, identity-based policies regardless of location, reducing attack surfaces, and simplifying network management
