UTP Cables (untwisted pair cable)
- lightweight & less expensive
STP (Shielded Twisted Pair)
- keep away EMI
- better for longer distances
- more expensive than UTP

Cat 6
Cat 6a
Cat 7
Cat 8
- designed for high-speed & short dist. b/w servers
Coaxial (Coax) Cable
- consists of a single copper conductor at its core w/ insulating layer & conductive shield

Twisted pair? --> UTP or STP --> CAT 5, 5e, 6, 6a, 7, 8 --> Plenum or Non-plenum

Copper Network Connections
- Registered Jack (RJ-X) --> ex: RJ-11 or RJ-45 (used for twisted pair cables)
	- telecom network interface for connecting voice and data to a service provided by a local exchange carrier or long-distance carrier.
- Radio Jack (RG-X) --> RG-6 or RG-059

RJ-45
- most common connector for LAN 

F-type
- standard for cable, satellite, can be also used for cable internet

RG-6
- coaxial cable for cable
