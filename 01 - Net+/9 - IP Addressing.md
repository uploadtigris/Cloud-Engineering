IPv4 Addressing
![[Pasted image 20251220200538.png]]
- Hosts = 2**(32 - n) - 2 --> where n = network bits (each octet == 8 bits)
- Class D reserved for "multi-casting"
	- a network communication method that efficiently sends a single stream of data from one source to multiple specific destinations (a "group") simultaneously
- CIDR notation
	- x.x.x.x\24 means 24 network bits
