## Exam Day Strategy

1. **Start with PBQs or skip them:** If you see PBQs first, read them quickly. If they look easy, do them. If complex, flag and come back.
    
2. **Time management:** 90 questions in 90 minutes = 1 minute per question. You'll likely finish early.
    
3. **Read carefully:** Questions often have "BEST" or "MOST" answers. All options may be technically correct.
    
4. **Flag and review:** Mark questions you're unsure about, come back if you have time.
    
5. **Process of elimination:** Cross out obviously wrong answers first.
    
6. **Don't overthink:** Your first instinct is usually correct.
