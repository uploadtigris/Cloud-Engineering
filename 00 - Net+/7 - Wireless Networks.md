Wireless Network Types
- Ad Hoc
	- peer-to-peer connection instead of a central access point
- Infrastructure
	- devices connected to network via WAP in a wired LAN
	- BSSID --> MAC of the WAP
	- SSID --> alphanumeric name to connect to the wireless network
	- ESS --> creates a larger network that share same SSID, allowing for seamless connectivity across a building
- Point-to-point
	- connect two distinct locations over long distances using high-gain antennas
- Mesh
	- Wireless Mesh Networks
		- self healing
		- large scale capabilities
	- Lightweight Access Point
		- connection nodes, not the central AP

Wireless Antennas
- Omnidirectional antennas 
	- transmits and receive signals in ALL directions
- Unidirectional antennas
	- one direction
- Yagi antennas
	- high signal
	- narrow beam
	- a type of unidirectional
- Parabolic antenna
	- focuses the energy and one direction --> used for TV

Wireless Security
1) Open networks are networks with no security, no protection, and no password
2) WEP is associated with the term Initialization Vector (IV)
3) WPA is associated with the terms TKIP (replaced IVs) an RC4 (encryption used in WPA and WEP)
4) WPA2 is associated with the terms CCMP (integrity protocol we used) and AES (encryption of WPA2)
5) WPA3 is associated with the term SAE
6) WPS uses a push-button configuration and should be disabled
7) Pre-shared key is associated with a password used in a personal mode of a wireless network
8) Enterprise mode is associated with using an individual username and password for each user

Captive Portals
- a page that client is redirected to when attempting to access the network
