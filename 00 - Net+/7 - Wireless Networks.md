Wireless Network Types
- Ad Hoc
	- peer-to-peer connection instead of a central access point
- Infrastructure
	- devices connected to network via WAP in a wired LAN
	- BSSID --> MAC of the WAP
	- SSID --> alphanumeric name to connect to the wireless network
	- ESS --> creates a larger network that share same SSID, allowing for seamless connectivity across a building
- Point-to-point
	- connect two distinct locations over long distances using high-gain antennas
- Mesh
	- Wireless Mesh Networks
		- self healing
		- large scale capabilities
	- Lightweight Access Point
		- connection nodes, not the central AP

Wireless Antennas
- Omnidirectional antennas 
	- transmits and receive signals in ALL directions
- Unidirectional antennas
	- one direction
- Yagi antennas
	- high signal
	- narrow beam
	- a type of unidirectional
- Parabolic antenna
	- focuses the energy and one direction --> used for TV
