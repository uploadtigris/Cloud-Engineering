I had a conversation with a GPT Chatbot and come up with this roadmap for me to follow for now.

## ERP Cloud Engineering Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Linux Foundations  
- Learn system administration using **Rocky Linux** and *The Linux Bible* by C. Negus 
- Practice user management, networking, automation, and shell scripting  
- Earn the **RHCSA certification** to validate practical Linux skills  

### Phase 2 — Cloud Infrastructure  
- Start with **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CCP)** to understand core services  
- Advance to **AWS SysOps Administrator** and **AWS Networking** to manage production infrastructure  
- Apply Linux knowledge to deploy and maintain secure cloud systems  

### Phase 3 — ERP & Operations Projects  
- Choose an ERP platform (Odoo, SAP, or Oracle Cloud ERP)  
- Integrate ERP systems with **AWS services** (EC2, S3, RDS, etc.)  
- Build small projects focused on automation and operational efficiency  

### Phase 4 — Data Engineering  
- Learn **AWS Data Engineer** concepts (Glue, Athena, Redshift)  
- Develop ETL workflows and analytics pipelines for ERP data  
- Build dashboards and forecasting models for operations and supply chain insights  

### Focus Summary  
- **Core Stack:** Rocky Linux • AWS • ERP Systems  
- **Certifications:** RHCSA • AWS CCP • AWS SysOps • AWS Data Engineer  
- **Goal:** Become an **ERP Cloud Engineer** with expertise in Linux, cloud infrastructure, and data-driven operations

I need to update the rest of my Cloud Engineering roadmap repo to reflect this.
I will begin with going through *the Linux Bible* and practice using Rocky Linux in a VM on my Fedora Workstation in the Virtual Machine Manager Hypervisor.
