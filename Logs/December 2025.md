**12/2/25**: 
- Switching my direction toward HPC Cluster Engineering
- This requires me to get a job as:
  1) Junior Linux Admin
  2) Data Center Technician
  3) Systems Administrator
- I will focus on my RHCSA and then my CCNA later
- Linux is the focus right now. Learn to Linux first --> Linux Bible --> Red Hat Labs --> Take RHCSA
