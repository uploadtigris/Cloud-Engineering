[What Is REST API?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mN3VyJuCjM/)
- REST API
	- Each resource is specified in a "URI" which describes the resource as a noun
	- HTTP methods
		- POST --> CREATE
		- GET --> READ
		- PUT --> UPDATE
		- DELETE --> DELETE
		- *the above is what "CRUD" stands for*
	- HTTPS codes
		- 200-level --> success
			- 200 - successful request for existing resource or general successful operation
			- 201 - specifically signifies that new resource has been successfully created a result of the request
		- 400-level --> something wrong with our request
			- 400 - syntax is incorrect in the request
			- 401 - the requested resource does not exist on the server
		- 500-level --> something wrong at the server level
	- pagination
		- use when there is a larger amount of data
		- ex: `/products?limit=25&offset=50`
	- versioning
		- backward compatibility
		- `/v1/products
		- `/v2/products`
	- view a site's API response
		- `graph.youtube.com`
		- `mpas.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=chicago&sensor=false`
	- "stateless"
		- this means that client and server do not need to store information about each other to maintain connection and service
