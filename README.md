# ☁️ Cloud Engineering Roadmap

A personal roadmap documenting my progression from Help Desk / Junior SysAdmin to Cloud Engineer.  
This repository will hold notes, projects, and automation scripts as I move through each learning phase.

---

## 🐧 Phase 1: Infrastructure & Automation (Local)
**Goal:** Automate and containerize Linux workloads.

### Projects
- [ ] Create a self-hosted web server (NGINX or Apache) on a local VM  
- [ ] Automate the setup using a **Bash script** or **Ansible playbook**  
- [ ] Containerize it using **Docker**  
- [ ] *(Optional)* Use **Docker Compose** to link multiple containers (e.g., web + database)

**Skills Learned:**  
Linux administration · Networking · Docker · Scripting · Automation

---

## ☸️ Phase 2: Container Orchestration (Intermediate)
**Goal:** Learn Kubernetes the right way — small and local first.

### Projects
- [ ] Deploy a **3-node Kubernetes cluster** locally using **k3s** or **minikube**  
- [ ] Deploy your Dockerized app to the cluster  
- [ ] Expose services and manage scaling  
- [ ] Install **Rancher** to visualize and manage your cluster

**Skills Learned:**  
Kubernetes basics · YAML · Container orchestration · Helm · Rancher UI

---

## ☁️ Phase 3: Cloud Infrastructure
**Goal:** Migrate what you’ve built to the cloud.

### Projects
- [ ] Set up an **AWS Free Tier** account  
- [ ] Deploy the same app with:
  - EC2 (compute)
  - S3 (storage)
  - IAM (security)
  - CloudFormation or Terraform (infrastructure-as-code)
- [ ] Add a **CI/CD pipeline** with **GitHub Actions** to automate deployments

**Skills Learned:**  
AWS core services · Infrastructure as Code (IaC) · CI/CD · Automation workflows

---

## 🧩 Phase 4: Monitoring & Scaling (Advanced Portfolio Project)
**Goal:** Simulate a production-grade deployment.

### Projects
- [ ] Build a small web service (e.g., a Flask app or API)  
- [ ] Deploy it on **Kubernetes in AWS** using **Terraform**  
- [ ] Add monitoring with **Prometheus + Grafana**  
- [ ] Add centralized logging with **ELK Stack** or **CloudWatch**

**Skills Learned:**  
End-to-end cloud infrastructure · Monitoring · Scaling · Reliability

## 🔧 Tools & Topics to Prioritize

| Category | Tools / Skills |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Cloud Fundamentals** | AWS (EC2, S3, IAM, VPC), Azure, or GCP basics |
| **Scripting** | Bash + Python |
| **Infrastructure as Code** | Terraform, CloudFormation |
| **Containers** | Docker, Kubernetes, Rancher |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions, Jenkins |
| **Monitoring & Logging** | Prometheus, Grafana, ELK |
| **OS Fundamentals** | Linux systemd, journald, networking, permissions |
| **Version Control** | Git & GitHub |

---

## 🧠 Strategy for Skill Growth

- 🧩 **Rotate between building and reading.**  
  Alternate between hands-on projects and reading documentation (Docker docs, AWS whitepapers).

- 🗓️ **One weekend project per month.**  
  Keep it small but complete — every project should be *demo-able*.

- 🪣 **Document everything.**  
  Each project gets a subfolder with architecture diagrams, screenshots, and commands.

- 🎯 **Certifications (when ready):**  
  - AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner → Fundamentals  
  - AWS Solutions Architect – Associate → After project experience  
  - Linux Foundation Certified SysAdmin (LFCS) → Linux mastery

---

## 🚀 Example Progression

| Year | Focus |
|------|--------|
| **Year 1** | Help Desk → Junior SysAdmin → Start Docker & AWS projects |
| **Year 2** | SysAdmin / Cloud Support → Build Kubernetes and Terraform projects |
| **Year 3** | Cloud Engineer / DevOps Associate → Automate full environments, CI/CD, monitoring |

### 📝 Notes
This repository is a living roadmap — it will grow with my skills.  
Each phase will include project documentation, code samples, and automation scripts as I progress.
