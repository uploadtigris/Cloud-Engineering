# ☁️ Cloud Engineering Roadmap (AWS-First, Fast-Track)

This is my personal roadmap for moving from **Help Desk Technician** into **Cloud Engineering**, with a focus on AWS, automation, and practical hands-on skills.

I’m using this repo to store my notes, labs, diagrams, and projects as I work toward cloud-focused roles like CloudOps, Cloud Support, or Junior Cloud Engineer.

---

# 🧱 Core Philosophy

I’m shifting away from basic help desk tasks and leaning into work that actually builds systems, not just fixing them.

My goal is to go from:

**“resetting passwords” → “deploying and automating cloud infrastructure.”**

This roadmap reflects that direction. It focuses on:

* **AWS Solutions Architect Associate (SAA)**
* **Learn to Cloud for hands-on experience**
* **Automation skills with PowerShell, Bash, and Git**
* **DevOps fundamentals (Docker + CI/CD)**
* **Building real cloud projects that belong in a portfolio**

# 🧰 Phase 1: Learn to Cloud Foundations

**Goal:** Build a solid cloud foundation with hands-on projects instead of pure theory.

### What I’m focusing on

* IAM + AWS CLI
* EC2 basics
* VPC basics
* S3
* CloudWatch logs/metrics
* Light Linux fundamentals

### Projects

* EC2 deployments with user data
* Custom IAM policies
* Multi-tier VPC setup
* S3 static site
* CloudWatch dashboards

**Outcome:** A solid baseline and a portfolio to prove it.

---

# ☁️ Phase 2: AWS Solutions Architect Associate (SAA)

**Goal:** Earn the most valuable beginner cloud certification.

### What I’m learning

* AWS compute, storage, and networking
* IAM permissions and security
* Load balancing + autoscaling
* Databases
* High availability + fault tolerance
* How to build reliable architectures

**Why this matters:**
SAA is the top cert for breaking into Cloud Support, CloudOps, or Junior Cloud Engineering roles.

---

# 🔧 Phase 3: CloudOps & Automation Foundations

**Goal:** Learn the automation and tooling every cloud engineer uses.

### Tools & Skills

* Git + GitHub
* Bash & PowerShell scripting
* Docker basics
* GitHub Actions workflows

### Projects

* Automated user scripts
* Containerizing a simple app
* CI/CD pipelines for small projects

---

# 🏗 Phase 4: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

**Goal:** Build and manage cloud resources using code.

### Tools

* **Terraform** (primary focus)
* **Ansible** (optional)

### Projects

* Terraform VPC builds
* EC2 infrastructure modules
* Reusable Terraform modules

---

# 🔌 Phase 5: AWS Deep Dive — VPC & Core Infrastructure

**Goal:** Learn the cloud fundamentals employers expect for real production environments.

### Topics

* VPC design patterns
* NAT, IGW, routing
* Load balancers
* Route 53
* IAM advanced use
* Monitoring

### Projects

* Multi-tier architectures
* ALB → EC2 deployments
* Route 53 with health checks
* Centralized logging setup

---

# 🧩 Phase 6: DevOps & SRE Basics

**Goal:** Understand how production systems stay healthy and reliable.

### Topics

* Intro Kubernetes
* Observability (logs, metrics, dashboards)
* Incident response basics
* SLOs/SLIs
* Auto-healing concepts

### Projects

* Deploy an app to a managed K8s cluster
* CloudWatch + Grafana dashboards
* Simple alerting + monitoring pipelines
